# shinyTextMining
This is a Shiny app that works with the rtweet package to query the information from twitter. The purpose of this app is to automatize the text mining analysis workflow performed in R. The actual version of this app successfully performs the query of tweets, cleans the data and creates a graph with the correlation between an arbitrary word. 

The download of tweets is under development.
